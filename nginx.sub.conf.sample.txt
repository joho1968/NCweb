# Sample Nginx configuration for running NCweb in a sub-directory
# with PHP-FPM. This goes inside your server { } block. This will
# handle requests to yourdomain.com/ncweb/*

# Configuration for NCweb at /ncweb

location /ncweb {
  # Where index.php is located physically on your server
  alias /home/html/yourdomain.com/public_html/ncweb;
  
  # Nginx will try to handle the request, or send it to 
  # index.php, or rewrite the URL and send it to the @ncweb
  # handler below
  try_files $uri index.php @ncweb;

  # Make sure we serve static content here, and not Nginx
